A \"POOF\" haircut, many \"HOW EVEN\" skies and sunsets, and other great events.\n\nI've been too lazy to post here, but as a general update, I've passed my first semester (somehow). Classes keep going on, and March was a roller coaster, but a good one overall.\n\nI'm excited for April, but mujhe ghar jaana hai.\n",
