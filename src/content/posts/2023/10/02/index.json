I've climbed a lot of stairs and tried my best to be a plant dad.\n\nThe fact that I was still in the 1st sem. of college at the start of this year is crazy. The fact that there's only 3 more months left in the year is crazy. The fact that I have an exam tomorrow is crazy.\n\nI really want to chase sunsets. I really want to run till my lungs give away.\n",
