I see the airport as a place of reflection, since I have nothing else to do but swipe through my photo gallery.\n\nThe first year of college has ended, and I have many, many pictures to look back to, only a fraction of which will end up here. Then again, the pictures are only a fraction of the moments engraved into my memory.\n\nLots of love to all my friends, my roommates, and everyone I couldn't take pictures with (we'll see in 2 months). Mai ghar jaa raha hoon.\n",
